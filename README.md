# Music Player

This is a simple Python script that uses the `tkinter` and `pygame libraries to create a basic music player. It allows you to select an MP3 file, play it, pause it, adjust the volume, and skip to the next or previous song.

## Installation

To use this script, you'll need to have Python 3 installed on your computer. You can download Python from the official website: https://www.python.org/downloads/

You'll also need to install the `tkinter` and `pygame` libraries. You can do this using pip, the Python package manager, by running the following commands:

```
pip install tkinter
pip install pygame
```

## Usage

To use the script, simply run it from the command line:

```
python music_player.py
```

The script will open a window with a "Select Song" button. Click this button to choose an MP3 file to play. Once you've selected a song, the "Play", "Previous", and "Next" buttons will become active.

Click the "Play" button to start playing the song. You can pause the song by clicking the "Play" button again. To adjust the volume, use the volume slider. To skip to the next or previous song, use the "Next" and "Previous" buttons.
